## Core Mechanics
### Gameplay Routes
To maximize the amount of freedom that player’s have, the game will be tailored for three different play styles or gameplay routes that have different types of tasks to complete.
#### Pirate Route
Build or buy a boat and form/hire a crew and sail the sea in search of treasure and loot and amass an armada and eventually form a nation.
#### Imperial Route
Start the game as an expendable naval soldier for one of the already established factions and accomplish quests to eventually make your way up to higher ranks.
#### Trade Route
Buy and sell goods from an owned shop in order to profit from neighboring settlements.  You can buy and sell shops and order ships to make deliveries to other places.
Although there are three routes of gameplay it does not mean you can’t mix them. Become a corrupt admiral or a black market dealer, there are many possibilities.

## NPC's
Take on the base of society, performing tasks and various things, which might include having a set routine that they complete based on time of year, day, week, etc.

## Combat
Combat is split between naval and land combat. Naval combat will mainly uses mounted weapons while land combat employs all types of weapons.

## Economy
The premise of having an in-game economy is to purchase or plunder resources in one region of the world, and then sell them for the highest price possible through dynamic pricing. There are also luxury items that are more rare, and require more skill to obtain. Additonally, based on your actions in the world, governing bodies can and will impose tarriffs on certain items.

## Building
Buidling allows the player to set up a settlement or base at a location of their choosing, and each of the three routes allows for their own unique attributes.
